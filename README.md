# SYD366 - Software Analysis and Design
*Requirements Gathering Using OO Models*

This repository contains all of my course work which I performed in the above mentioned course.

----------------------------------------
Course Description
----------------------------------------
After successful completion of this course, it helped me to...
```
  * introduce to requirements gathering and systems design using a small business
    (sole proprietorship) as a case study.
  * gain an understanding of the Canadian business environment, while documenting the
    required design models for the case study.
  * come up with business solutions designed using OO design techniques.
  * learn existing enterprise software which are surveyed as the question of purchase or build software is explored.
  * focuses on the techniques and tools involved in gathering requirements for business systems
    that will solve business stakeholders' processing problems. 
  * introduce to system development life cycles and interface design.
  * learn how to use research, observation, interviews, prototypes and feedback to gather stakeholders'
    requirements.
  * learn how to document requirements in both business and systems use case diagrams using the
    Unified Modeling Language (UML) and the Rational Rose modeling tool.
  * learn to write the use case descriptions, both business and systems.
  * learn in-depth case study will be used throughout the subject to allow to apply what I learnt.
  * Follow an Object-oriented methodology
  * Draw systems use case diagrams showing actor to use case relationships and use case to use case relationships
  * Model the primary business functionality in Business Use Case Diagrams
  * Perform the research and information gathering required to determine what a proposed system needs to accomplish
  * Identify all activities within a proposed system, as well as who initiates them
  * Transform activities into use cases
  * Describe use cases in writing following a given template
  * Describe in writing the phases involved in developing a system
  * Apply basic interface design concepts to create mock-ups (e.g. web page, screen and mock-ups reports)
  * Work effectively as part of a system development team to deliver a requirements model
  * Perform a user interface walk-through
  * Articulate (in writing) what a proposed system needs to accomplish
  * Use Rational Rose software to create the use case view of a software model
  * Perform a requirements walk-through
  * Communicate clearly, concisely and correctly in the written, spoken and visual form that fulfils the purpose and meets the needs of the audience.
  * Apply a systematic approach to solve problems.
  * Use a variety of thinking skills to anticipate and solve problems.
  * Locate, select, organize, and document information using appropriate technology and information systems.
  * Analyze, evaluate, and apply relevant information from a variety of sources.
  * Show respect for diverse opinions, values, belief systems, and contributions of others.
  * Interact with others in groups or teams in ways that contribute to effective working relationships and the achievement of goals.
  * Manage the use of time and other resources to complete projects.
  * Take responsibility for one's own actions, decisions, and consequences.

* Gain a handsome knowledge on all of the topics of Software Analysis & Design namely-
